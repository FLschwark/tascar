This receiver renders for ITU 5.1 loudspeaker layouts. Point sources
are panned using VBAP on the C, L, R, Ls and Rs speakers. A warped
space is used (0° mapped to C, $\pm$45° mapped to L and R, $\pm$135°
mapped to Ls and Rs) to achieve a stable image in the frontal speaker
set and to avoid excess intensities on the rear speakers. Diffuse
sounds are rendered to L, R, Ls and Rs speakers, without
de-correlation of the speaker signals. The LFE channel is created
using an omni-directional characteristics (both, point sources and
diffuse sound fields), and low pass filtered.

\begin{tscattributes}
\indattr{fc} & LFE cut off frequency in Hz (80)\\
\indattr{diffusegainfront} & Diffuse gain for frontal speakers in dB (-6)\\
\indattr{diffusegainrear} & Diffuse gain for rear speakers in dB (0)\\
\end{tscattributes}
