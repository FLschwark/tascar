This receiver renders for ITU 5.1 loudspeaker layouts. Point sources
are panned using VBAP on the C, L, R, Ls and Rs speakers. A warped
space is used (0° mapped to C, $\pm$45° mapped to L and R, $\pm$135°
mapped to Ls and Rs) to achieve a stable image in the frontal speaker
set and to avoid excess intensities on the rear speakers. Diffuse
sounds are rendered to L, R, Ls and Rs speakers, without
de-correlation of the speaker signals. The LFE channel is created
using an omni-directional characteristics (both, point sources and
diffuse sound fields), and low pass filtered.
