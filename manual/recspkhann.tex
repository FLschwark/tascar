Panning of audio between two best-matching speakers with von-Hann
ramps.

If $N$ speakers are defined, $\alpha$ is the angle between a speaker
$k$ and the virtual sound source, and $\gamma$ is the window exponent
(\indattr{wexp}), then the speaker gain $g_k$ is
\begin{equation}
w_k = \left(\frac12 + \frac12 \cos\left(\frac{N}{2} \alpha\right)\right)^\gamma
\end{equation}
