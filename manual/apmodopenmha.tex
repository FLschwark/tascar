Load an openmha plugin for audio processing. Currently, plugins which
change the channel configuration (e.g., sampling rate, number of
channels, or fragment size) can not be used.

\begin{tscattributes}
\indattr{plugin} & Plugin name\\
\indattr{config} & Configuration command handed to openmha\\
\end{tscattributes}

Configuration can also be provided as embedded text in the
\elem{openmha} element.
