Generic first-order microphone, directivity can be controlled between
omni and figure-of-eight.

The virtual microphone receiver type has a single output channel. The
driving weight is
\begin{equation}
w = 1 + a (\tilde{p}_{rel,x} - 1).
\end{equation}
Its directivity pattern can be controlled between omni-directional and
figure-of-eight with the directivity coefficient $a$; with $a=0$ this
is an omni-directional microphone, with $a=\frac12$ a standard
cardioid, and with $a=1$ a figure-of-eight.

The diffuse decoding matrix is
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{D} = \left( \sqrt{2}(1-a) \quad a \quad 0\quad  0 \right).
\end{equation}
The factor \(\sqrt{2}\) of the \(w\)-channel is needed to account for
the Furse-Malham normalization of the diffuse signals.
