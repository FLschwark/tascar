Omnidirectional microphone.

\begin{lstlisting}[numbers=none]
<receiver type="omni"/>
\end{lstlisting}

If we use the simple omni-directional receiver, then sources coming
from all directions are rendered with the same weight $w=1$ and at the
output of the renderer we will get just one channel, $N=1$ - the
summation of sources from all directions:

$N=1$,
$w_n=1$
