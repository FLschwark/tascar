This receiver implements a classical ORTF stereo microphone
technique. The cardioid microphone pattern has a frequency dependency;
the 6~dB cutoff frequency for 90 degrees is given by the attribute
\indattr{f6db}. The attribute \indattr{fmin} defines the cutoff
frequency for 180 degree sounds. The attributes \indattr{distance} and
\indattr{angle} control the microphone geometry.

Typical values for small diaphragms are \attr{f6db="3000"} and
\attr{fmin="800"} (these are the default values since version
0.172.2); for a higher directivity, use \attr{f6db="1000"} and
\attr{fmin="60"} (default values of earlier versions).
