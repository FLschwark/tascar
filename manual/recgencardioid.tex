If we use a cardioidal receiver, then sources are multiplied with a
different weight (depending on the direction of arrival, according to
cardioidal directivity pattern) and at the output of the renderer we
will also get just one channel - a summation of sources coming from
different directions multiplied with different weights.
 
$N=1$, $w_n=\frac{1}{2}(cos(\alpha) +1)$,\\
where \(w(n)\) depends on
the angle between the source and the receiver, $\alpha$ (direction
from which the source is coming).
