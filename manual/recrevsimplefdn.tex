This receiver implements a simple Feedback Delay Network (FDN). To set
the room dimensions, use the \attr{volumetric} attribute. By default,
the $T_{60}$ is calculated using the Sabine's formula, see
\attr{absorption}. If an explicit $T_{60}$ is provided, this is used
and the \attr{absorption} attribute is ignored.
