soundsource:

- base of any non-diffuse sound source
- audio container (const, filled on each cycle)
- "virtual audio_t process( receiverstate& ) const" method returns audio
- receiver state contains current receiver position and all variables 
- distance law?

primary source:

multiple types, defined by dynamic librrary

- defined in scene
- provides input port

- types: omni, portal (directional: diffraction), other directional sources
- defined in scene

- provides 

image source:

- generated by image model
- at beginning of each cycle: fill buffer, apply reflection processing
- radiation model of parent type are called


----------------------
acoustic model: created for each pair of (source,receiver):

- radiation model: depends on source type and relative direction of receiver
- transmission model: depends on distance (and source type?)
- receiver model: depends on receiver type and relative direction of receiver
